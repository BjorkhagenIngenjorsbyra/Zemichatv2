<h2>4. The transparency model</h2>
<h3>4.1 Core principle</h3>
<p>Zemichat's transparency model means that the Team Owner has full insight into Texters' communication. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>All messages that Texters send and receive.</li>
<li>Deleted messages (marked as deleted but not removed).</li>
<li>Message edit history.</li>
<li>Call logs.</li>
</ul>
<h3>4.2 Super's privacy</h3>
<p>Chats between Supers (adults) where no Texter participates are private and cannot be seen by the Team Owner. This separation is a fundamental part of the service's design.</p>
<h3>4.3 Consent</h3>
