## 3. Account creation and responsibility

### 3.1 Who can create an account

- **Team Owner and Super:** Must have a valid email address and be at least 18 years old.
- **Texter:** Created by the Team Owner. Texters may be under 18 years old but require approval from a parent or legal guardian (Team Owner).

### 3.2 Your responsibility

You are responsible for:

- Keeping your login credentials secure and not sharing them with unauthorized persons.
- Ensuring the information you provide during registration is accurate.
- All activity that occurs under your account.

### 3.3 Team Owner's responsibility

As a Team Owner, you are additionally responsible for:

- Having the right to act as a parent or legal guardian for the Texters you create.
- Informing Texters that their communication is visible to you (the transparency model).
- Managing your team's settings, friend requests, and permissions responsibly.

---

## 4. The transparency model

### 4.1 Core principle

Zemichat's transparency model means that the Team Owner has full insight into Texters' communication. This includes:

- All messages that Texters send and receive.
- Deleted messages (marked as deleted but not removed).
- Message edit history.
- Call logs.

### 4.2 Super's privacy

Chats between Supers (adults) where no Texter participates are private and cannot be seen by the Team Owner. This separation is a fundamental part of the service's design.

### 4.3 Consent

By using Zemichat as a Texter, or by creating a Texter profile, you confirm that you understand and accept the transparency model.
